# MCAnalyzer
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/vchuravy/MCAnalyzer.jl.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/vchuravy/MCAnalyzer.jl)

`MCAnalyzer.jl` provides a interface to the [*Intel Architecture Code Analyzer*](https://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/intel-architecture-code-analyzer) and [*LLVM MCA*](https://www.llvm.org/docs/CommandGuide/llvm-mca.html) for Julia functions.

## Installation

First manually install `iaca` from https://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/intel-architecture-code-analyzer and then install this package.
If `iaca` is not on your path set the environment variable `IACA_PATH=...` to point to the `iaca` binary that you downloaded from Intel.

## Usage

`MCAnalyzer.jl` provides the two functions `mark_start` and `mark_end`  both will insert some special markers into you code.
`iaca` will then analyse the generated object file and only analyse the parts in between the two markers.

To invoke `iaca` on a specific method that has been annotated use `analyze(func, tt)` where `tt` is a tuple of types that gives the type signature of the method.

### Supported architectures

- `HSW`: Haswell
- `BDW`: Broadwell
- `SKL`: Skylake
- `SKX`: Skylake-X

By default `analyse` will use `SKL`, but you can supply a target architecture through `analyze(func, tt, :SKX)`

### Caveats

`iaca` 3.0 currently only supports *throughput* analysis. This means that currently it is only useful to analyze loops.
`mark_start()` has to be in the beginning of the loop body and `mark_end()` has to be after the loop. `iaca` will then treat the loop as an infite loop.

It is recommended to use `@code_llvm`/`@code_native` to inspect the IR/assembly and check that the annotations are
in the expected place.

### Examples

```julia
using MCAnalyzer

function mysum(A)
    acc = zero(eltype(A))
    for i in eachindex(A)
        mark_start()
        @inbounds acc += A[i]
    end
    mark_end()
    return acc
end

analyze(mysum, Tuple{Vector{Float64}})
```

```julia
using MCAnalyzer

function f(y::Float64)
    x = 0.0
    for i=1:100
        mark_start()
        x += 2*y*i
    end
    mark_end()
    x
end

analyze(f, Tuple{Float64})
```

```julia
using MCAnalyzer

function g(y::Float64)
    x1 = x2 = x3 = x4 = x5 = x6 = x7 = 0.0
    for i=1:7:100
        mark_start()
        x1 += 2*y*i
        x2 += 2*y*(i+1)
        x3 += 2*y*(i+2)
        x4 += 2*y*(i+3)
        x5 += 2*y*(i+4)
        x6 += 2*y*(i+5)
        x7 += 2*y*(i+6)
    end
    mark_end()
    x1 + x2 + x3 + x4 + x5 + x6 + x7
end

analyze(g, Tuple{Float64})
```

### Advanced usage

#### Switching opt-level

```julia
MCAnalyzer.optlevel[] = 3
analyze(mysum, Tuple{Vector{Float64}}, :SKL)
````

#### Changing the optimization pipeline

```julia
myoptimize!(tm, mod) = ...
analyze(mysum. Tuple{Vector{Float64}}, :SKL, #=optimize!=# myoptimize!)
````
#### Changing the analyzer tool

```julia
MCAnalyzer.analyzer[] = MCAnalyzer.llvm_mca
analyze(mysum, Tuple{Vector{Float64}})
```

## Notes

`MCAnalyzer.jl` only supports version 3.0 of `iaca`. The [online documentation for version 3.0](https://software.intel.com/sites/default/files/managed/3d/23/intel-architecture-code-analyzer-3.0-users-guide.pdf) is easily available, and contains a more detailed explanation and a few more examples.

- Version 3.0 only support [`Throughput Analysis`](https://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/intel-architecture-code-analyzer#Throughput Analysis)
- The user guide for version 2.0 is available at https://progforperf.github.io/MCAnalyzer-Guide.pdf
- http://www.agner.org/optimize/
